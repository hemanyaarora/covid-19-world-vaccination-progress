# covid-19-world-vaccination-progress
With the escalating number of COVID-19 cases around the globe, monitoring the vaccination progress across countries is of utmost importance with respect to controlling the spread of this virus. This project focuses on the current demographics of vaccinations across countries and the interesting studies emerging from studying this dataset. In addition to this, we limit our analysis to the following areas:

- Demographics of a country's response to the vaccination progress over the course of time.
- Understanding the trends of the vaccine companies in comparison with the percentage of immunized population.
- Delineating the findings about the data and answering unique questions relevant to the information.
